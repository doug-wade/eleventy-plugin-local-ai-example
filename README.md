This repository demonstrates how to use [`eleventy-plugin-local-ai`](https://npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-local-ai). For full documentation, see its README.

## Getting Started

First, fork and clone the repository and change your working directory to the root of this example.

Next, install the dependencies

yarn install
```

Then, run the site

The LocalAI generated site should now be running on port 3000. Open http://localhost:3000/ to see your running site. There should also be two other pages: http://localhost:3000/corgis and http://localhost:3000/dashshunds.
